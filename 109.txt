normal distributions are the most interesting patterns in data science 

properties of normal distribution
the mean, median and mode are all equal in normal distribution and they are at the peak

2) symmetrical nature of normal distribution 
mean divides into 2 equal parts , in y axis (bellcurve) it shows probability of the data 

3) 68% of data lies between the first standard deviation (between mean - sd to mean + sd)
95% of data the second standard deviation (mean - 2sd to mean + 2sd)

99% of data lies between the third standard deviation (between mean - 3sd to mean + 3sd)
